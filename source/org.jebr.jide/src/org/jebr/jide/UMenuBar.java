 * 
 * For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,
 * the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,
 * fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,
 * I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,
 * never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,
 * never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
 * 
 * Now, take the oath:
 * 
 * Errors gather, and now my maintenance begins. It shall not end until my death.
 * I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
 * I shall live and die maintaining this code. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the maintainer of the code.
 * I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers,
 * the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to maintain this code,
 * for this night and all the nights to come.
