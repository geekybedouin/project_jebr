       About
===================
Jebr is a static, imperative, object-oriented and domain-specific programming language that supports linear-algebra oriented operations and matrix manipulation to allow users to solve mathematical issues using programming logic. The language supports multiple programming paradigms and the WORA “Write Once, Run Anywhere” ideology.

Jebr difference from other linear-algebra-oriented programming languages springs from the fact that it's is a Free-software project that is simple but yet powerful, supports the WORA coding ideology, and it's free to examine and edit the code or any other language entity.

The project is considered to be the first domain-specific programming language developed entirely by An-Najah National University students. It is intended to serve in many fields; as a programming language to help students solving linear algebra problems through programming logic, as well as an example for them to analyze and develop in both “Programming Languages” and “Compiler Design” courses.
